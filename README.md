# 🚦 Traffic Density Analyzer

> **AI-powered Streamlit web application to analyze traffic density in highway videos using YOLOv8**

---

## ✨ **Project Overview**

Traffic congestion analysis is crucial for smart city planning and traffic management. This project utilizes **YOLOv8 object detection** to identify vehicles in each frame of a traffic video and visualize vehicle density trends interactively.

✅ **Key features:**

- Upload highway traffic videos (`.mp4`)  
- Frame-by-frame vehicle detection using YOLOv8  
- Displays sample annotated frames with vehicle counts  
- Plots traffic density trends across video frames  
- Deployed as a **Streamlit web app** for ease of use

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### 🔧 **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/traffic-density-analyzer.git
cd traffic-density-analyzer
````

### ⚙️ **2. Install Dependencies**

Ensure you have Python ≥3.8 installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** Dependencies include `streamlit`, `ultralytics`, `opencv-python`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.

### ▶️ **3. Run the Streamlit App**

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

The app will open in your default browser. Upload a sample video to test.

## 🎯 **How It Works**

1. **Upload Traffic Video:**
   Supports `.mp4` videos.

2. **Frame Processing:**
   Each frame is analyzed with **YOLOv8 (Nano variant)** for fast vehicle detection.

3. **Vehicle Counting:**
   Detects classes: **car, bus, truck, motorcycle, bicycle**.

4. **Sample Frames Display:**
   Shows every 100th frame annotated with detection boxes and counts.

5. **Density Visualization:**
   Plots vehicle count trends over video frames.

## 📦 **Dataset**

Used for testing and demonstration:

🔗 [Highway Traffic Videos Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/highway-traffic-videos-dataset)

🌐 **Test It Online (Hugging Face Spaces)**
🚀 **Try the deployed app in real-time: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Sri-Harish/Traffic-Density-Analyzer**

✅ No installation needed – runs directly on browser
---

## 💡 **Future Improvements**

* Integrate **real-time CCTV streams** for edge deployment
* Class-wise density analytics (truck vs. car vs. bike)
* Traffic congestion prediction using historical data trends
* Deploy on **Raspberry Pi** or **NVIDIA Jetson Nano** for true Edge AI implementation
